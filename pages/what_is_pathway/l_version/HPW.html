				<p>During each of the three semesters, students take just one online academic class from BYU-Idaho. The three academic classes incorporate English-language instruction as a main component of the coursework and are designed to give students the confidence and skills needed to succeed in college and life. The L version academic courses include Pathway English and Life Skills (GS 120L), English Language and Personal Finance (Math 100L), and English Language and Basic Writing (ENG 106L).</p>

				<h3 id="ReligionClasses" class="p-heading turquoise">Religion Courses</h3>
				<p>Because of the advantages for English-learning Church members, L version students are strongly encouraged to enroll in an institute class of their choice during the three semesters of Pathway.</p>
				<h3 id="WeeklyGathering" class="p-heading turquoise">Weekly Gathering</h3>
				<p>The program includes a 90-minute gathering each week at a local institute facility or church meetinghouse with other Pathway students and a service missionary couple. </p>

				<p>The gathering provides social, emotional, and academic support and is held every Thursday evening during the three BYU-Idaho academic semesters.</p>
