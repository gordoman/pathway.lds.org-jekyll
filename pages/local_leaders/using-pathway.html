        <p class="main-content">Pathway has been designed around three primary objectives, which
          are intended to serve as a catalyst in students' lives both academically
          and economically. In addition to the obvious educational and career
          benefits Pathway provides, perhaps the most valuable aspect of this
          program for the students who participate is the spiritual nourishment
          that comes through regular gospel study and the association of fellow
          students. Pathway's objectives are:
        </p>

        <!-- Numbered Header -->
        <p class="p-heading2 blue">1. GET THE GOSPEL DOWN INTO STUDENTS' HEARTS</p>
        <p class="main-content">Students' testimonies will grow as they enjoy the fellowship of other
          LDS students and participate in courses taught within the framework
          of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
        </p>

        <p class="p-heading2 blue">2. HELP STUDENTS BECOME CAPABLE LEARNERS</p>
        <p class="main-content">Pathway eases students into higher education and helps them build
          confidence in a supportive environment. As part of BYU-Idaho's
          Learning Model, students take control of their own learning through a
          process of preparation, teaching others, and internalizing their
          learning through reflection and application.
        </p>

        <p class="p-heading2 blue">3. PREPARE STUDENTS TO LEAD AND SUPPORT FAMILIES</p>
        <p class="main-content">Throughout their education, Pathway students will gain skills, learn
          doctrine, and strengthen values that will enable them to gain
          meaningful employment as well as be better parents, providers,
          citizens, and Church members.
        </p>

        <p class="main-content">Many Pathway students have reported significant benefits relative to
          their participation in Pathway. Students surveyed near the completion
          of their first year in the program have reported the following:
        </p>

        <p class="main-content">Pathway can be a great blessing to priesthood leaders who support
          the program and use it as a key part of their ministry. Many priesthood
          leaders have recognized the blessings Pathway can provide and use
          the program as a rescue tool with spiritually less-active or inactive
          Church members.

        <p class="p-heading blue">Foundation</p>
        <p class="main-content"  style="margin-bottom:50px;">For more than 120 years, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
          Saints has been offering educational opportunities to students in
          Rexburg, Idaho. However, it has long been realized that there is more
          the Church can do to provide a Church-based education to many
          more individuals. In 1971, Henry B. Eyring said the following in his
          inaugural address as president of then Ricks College:

            shaped by a great variety of cultures and
            situations, and who may not be able to
            come to this campus.... We will find direct
            ways to move the blessings of education
            ... from this campus out into the lives of
            men and women everywhere."

        <p class="main-content">Both of these men echoed a similar sentiment: BYU-Idaho must find
          ways to educate more students. And in 2009, a new program was
          introduced to do just that. Partnering with existing institutes of religion,
          the BYU-Idaho Pathway program was launched in three U.S. locations
          with about 50 students, and it has now grown to thousands of students
          in dozens of locations worldwide. The university has truly found, as
          Elder Eyring said, "direct ways to move the blessings of education ...
          from this campus out into the lives of men and woman everywhere."
