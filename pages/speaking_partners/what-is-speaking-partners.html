          <p>We’ve all heard that English is the “universal language.” But do you know why? Perhaps it’s because those who know English typically make more money than those who don’t. Or maybe it’s because 1/4 of the world’s population speak the language at a useful level. <br><br>But no matter the reason, one thing is certain &mdash; learning English sets people up for better opportunities educationally, socially, economically, and more. </p>
