        </div>
        <p>Pathway is a <strong class="turquoise">low-cost</strong> educational opportunity that mixes the flexibility of <strong class="turquoise">online courses</strong> with the benefits of <strong class="turquoise">local student-to-student interaction</strong>. Students earn college credit that is eligible for transfer to BYU-Idaho and other universities. The program takes one year (or three semesters) to complete and can lead to professional certificates and degrees.</p>

        <h3 id="Courses" class="p-heading turquoise">Courses</h3>
        <p>Each semester during Pathway, students take a light courseload consisting of both academic and religious education. Pathway courses are designed to help students learn basic skills and gain the confidence and abilities needed to succeed in college and in life.</p>

        <p>Pathway’s academic courses are offered online through BYU-Idaho. Religion classes for students age 18–30 are offered through local institute programs.</p>

        <h3 id="WeeklyGatherings" class="p-heading turquoise">Weekly Gatherings</h3>
        <p>In addition to taking academic and religion courses, Pathway students also gather every Thursday evening at a local institute or church meetinghouse. There, they meet with other classmates and Pathway missionaries where they participate in additional educational and leadership activities.</p>

        <p>This combination of online courses and weekly gatherings helps students develop meaningful and marketable skills — all within the framework of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It also allows students the flexibility to fit coursework around job schedules or other responsibilities, while enjoying the support of local family and friends.</p>
