        <h3 id="OnlineAcademicCourses" class="p-heading red">Online Academic Courses</h3>
        <p>During each of the three semesters, students take one online academic class from BYU-Idaho as well as one religion class. The three academic classes are designed to give students the confidence and skills needed to succeed in college and include Pathway Life Skills (GS 120), Basic Writing (ENG 106), and Personal Finance (Math 100G). </p>

        <p>During each of the three semesters, students take one of the following religion classes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Book of Mormon, Part 1 </li>

        <p>Pathway students are divided into group types: Age 18-30, Age 31+, and Age 18+. (The Age 18+ group is no longer available in the United States except for a few existing sites. Most international sites continue to approve and operate Age 18+ groups.)</p>
        <h4 class="p-heading2 red">Academic Courses</h4>
        <p>All groups complete their Pathway academic courses online and gather weekly at a local institute facility or church meetinghouse to discuss the lesson material, collaborate on assignments, and teach one another. </p>
        <h4 class="p-heading2 red">Religion Courses</h4>
        <p>Students in the Age 18-30 and Age 18+ groups complete their Book of Mormon courses through their local institute program at no charge, and the credits are then eligible for transfer to BYU-Idaho.</p>
        <p>Students in the Age 31+ group complete their Book of Mormon courses online through BYU-Idaho.</p>
        <p>All groups complete the FDREL 333, “Teachings of the Living Prophets,” course online through BYU-Idaho.</p>
