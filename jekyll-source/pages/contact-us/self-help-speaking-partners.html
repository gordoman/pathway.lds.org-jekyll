				<h4 id="whats_the_difference_between_Pathway_and_speaking_partners" class="accordion-heading">What's the difference between Pathway and Speaking Partners?</h4>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 id="do_i_need_to_know_a_foreign_language" class="accordion-heading">Do I need to know a foreign language?</h4>
				<div id="foreignlanguage" class="answer accordion">
					<p>No. If volunteers do know their partner’s native language, they should not use that language during their speaking partner appointments. Students in Pathway’s L version are required to use English in an effort to improve their language skills.</p>

				<div id="lengthofprogram" class="answer accordion">
					<p>The speaking partner activity for Pathway students lasts for a duration of 12 weeks each semester (starting the second week and finishing the next-to-last week). Volunteers must be available once a week for 30 minutes for the 12-week period.</p>
