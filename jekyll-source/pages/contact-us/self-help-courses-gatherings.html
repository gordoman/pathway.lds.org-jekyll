						<li>File a Complaint: If students are not able to resolve their issues through direct contact with their instructors, students have two options:

							<li>File an anonymous complaint: Students might do this when they want to inform Pathway administration regarding a minor situation. (Example: instructor not responding to email)</li>
							<li>File a formal grievance: Students might file a formal grievance when they are experiencing a major issue with an instructor, or when filing an anonymous complaint has not solved the problem. These complaints are not anonymous. (Examples: instructor harassing a student, instructor accusing a student of cheating without evidence)</li>

			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 class="accordion-heading">Am I required to go to the Pathway gatherings?</h4>
				<div id="gatheringsrequired" class="answer accordion">
					<p>Yes, attendance at weekly Pathway gatherings is expected and comprises a significant part of a student’s overall course grade. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 class="accordion-heading">Can I miss a gathering?</h4>
				<div id="missagathering" class="answer accordion">
					<p>Yes, but students lose attendance points in their course for every missed gathering. Because attendance comprises a significant part of a student’s overall course grade, students should commit to attending all gatherings.</p>
					<p>In certain situations, including medical emergencies, individual gatherings may be excused for a student. Such determinations, however, are made at the sole discretion of individual online instructors.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 class="accordion-heading">What do I do if my gathering is cancelled?</h4>
				<div id="gatheringcancelled" class="answer accordion">
					<p>In very rare instances, Pathway missionaries may cancel a gathering due to extreme weather or other unsafe situations. If such a situation occurs, students will not lose attendance points in their course. Students must notify their instructor(s) of the reason for the gathering cancellation, and request an attendance exception.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 class="accordion-heading">If I am traveling, can I attend a Pathway gathering in the area I am visiting and receive attendance credit?</h4>
				<div id="travel" class="answer accordion">
					<p>Yes, students who are traveling and are unable to attend their assigned academic gathering may attend another gathering in the city they are visiting and still obtain attendance credit. Traveling students are encouraged to attend a gathering with the same course as their own; however, students who do not have that option may attend any Pathway gathering. (This does not apply to institute courses.) Students should direct any attendance-related questions to their online instructors for BYU-Idaho courses or their institute instructor for institute courses.</p>
					<p>To find a gathering location in a city you are traveling to, do the following:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Search for a <a target="_blank" href="http://pathway.lds.org/finder/world">Pathway location</a>, and contact the local Pathway missionaries.
							<ul>
								<li>Contact information for each Pathway location is listed on individual location pages.</li>
