					<p>BYU-Idaho considers evaluation of transferrable institute course credits only with an official institute of religion transcript.

The transcripts only need to be submitted once to BYU-Idaho.</p>
					<p>To ensure timely processing, official transcripts should be sent to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.byui.edu/admissions">BYU-Idaho Admissions Office</a> as grades are posted. Typical processing time is 2–4 weeks from the time the transcript is received to appearance on the student's BYU-Idaho transcript. Transcripts should be sent to:</p>
