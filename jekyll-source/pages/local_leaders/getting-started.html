      <h3 class="p-heading blue">Priesthood Support</h3>
      <p class="main-content">For Pathway to succeed, local priesthood leadership and support are critical. In areas where Pathway has been most successful, priesthood leaders discuss the program openly in councils, training, or other church meetings. We recommend a tight alignment and investment in the program at the Seventy, stake (presidency, high council, auxiliary), and ward levels.
      </p>
      <p>Implementation of Pathway will be easier for those areas who have complete support from:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>Area Presidency (international locations mainly)</li>
       <li>Area Seventy</li>
       <li>Stake Presidents</li>
       <li>Institute Director (and CES Area Director)</li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="pf-section no-icon">
    <h3 class="p-heading blue">Assess Local Interest</h3>
    <p class="main-content">Pathway works best when multiple stakes work together to establish a central location for implementing the program. To gauge the scope of interest, Area Seventies and/or stake presidents may consider the following:</p>
    <div class="indent">
      <ol class="note blue"><li>Take 5 minutes in a coordinating council to show the video titled, <a style="color:#dc4831;;" href="{{site.baseurl}}pages/local-leaders/using-pathway.html">“Using Pathway in Your Ministry,”</a> featuring Kim B. Clark.,
        president of BYU-Idaho. This is a good opportunity to share brief information about the program and ask stake presidents how they feel about bringing Pathway to their area.</li>

        <li>Take a similar approach to #1 with stake councils and bishops training meetings. In turn, bishops can proceed to introduce Pathway to their ward councils.</li>
      </ol>

    <p class="main-content">For those desiring to provide more detailed information regarding Pathway, the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}pdfs/local_leaders/Pathway_Handbook_for_Church_Leaders.pdf" target="_blank"> Pathway Priesthood Leadership Guide</a> can be downloaded and distributed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pf-section no-icon">
   <h3 class="p-heading blue">Agent Stake President Assignment</h3>
   <p class="main-content">The effort to launch Pathway in an area can gain traction when a stake president either volunteers or is delegated to take the lead. Generally this means completing and submitting an <a style="color:#dc4831;;" href="{{site.baseurl}}pages/local_leaders/request-a-site.html">application to formally request Pathway,</a> coordinating the selection of <a style="color:#dc4831;" href="{{site.baseurl}}pages/local_leaders/roles-responsibilities.html#roleofpathwaymissionaries" target="_blank">Church Service Missionaries</a> to administer the program, and serving as a point of contact for BYU-Idaho until service missionaries are in place.</p>

   <h3 class="p-heading blue">Pathway Group Types and Locations</h3>
   <h4 class="p-heading2 blue">GROUP TYPES</h4>
   <p>Pathway may be offered to one or more group types. Students are assigned to a group at the time of admission, and assignments are based primarily on age. (Age 18-30 group, Age 31+ group, and Age 18+ group (international sites only)).</p>
   <h4 class="p-heading2 blue">GATHERING LOCATION(S)</h4>
   <p>As part of the application, a single gathering place that is central to all participating stakes should be selected for each group type. Gatherings take place weekly during the first year of the program and occur on Thursday evenings. For Pathway to be most successful, a minimum of 15 applicants (for a given group) is required to start a new class.</p>
   <p><span class="p-heading4 blue">Age 18-30 Group: </span> Gatherings are best suited at an institute building or a Church facility where institute classes are taught.</p>
   <p><span class="p-heading4 blue">Age 31+ Group:</span> Gatherings are best suited at a church meetinghouse or a stake center. Such gathering locations should be in close proximity to the Age 18-30 group location.</p>
   <p><span class="p-heading4 blue">Age 18+ Group (international locations only):</span> Gatherings may occur at either an institute facility or a church meetinghouse or stake center.</p>
   <p><span class="p-heading4 blue">L Version:</span> Gatherings are best suited at a church meetinghouse or a stake center (U.S. & Canada). Internationally, gatherings are also permitted at an institute facility.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="pf-section no-icon">
   <h3 class="p-heading blue">Recruitment</h3>
   <p>Pathway primarily targets young-adult Church members who are not currently attending college, but admission is open to all adult Church members. Identifying such individuals and encouraging them to give higher education a try requires a concerted effort on the part of local priesthood leaders and Pathway service missionaries. Pathway missionaries will head the recruiting effort, but priesthood and auxiliary leaders are asked to help support the missionaries in their efforts.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="pf-section no-icon">
   <h3 class="p-heading blue">Promote Initial Leadership Training Meeting</h3>
   <p>Upon approval<sup>1</sup>, the most successful sites encourage stake presidencies, stake Relief Society presidencies, high councilors with relevant assignments, institute directors, and other key leaders to attend a leadership training provided by a Pathway administrator. This training offers a more detailed overview of the program and an opportunity to strategically plan the implementation based on the best practices observed at other Pathway sites.</p>
   <p>BYU-Idaho trains Pathway missionaries to seek opportunities to take 5-30 minutes to present Pathway in stake and ward councils, combined priesthood/Relief Society meetings, firesides, and other meetings as approved by local leaders. There is a strong correlation between enrollment and the number of these presentations made by missionaries.</p>

   <hr />

   <div id="footnote">1 BYU-Idaho must seek and receive approval for each new Pathway site. While general communication  regarding the program is acceptable prior to that approval, formal efforts to implement Pathway may not occur until after BYU-Idaho provides notification that a site has been approved.</p>
