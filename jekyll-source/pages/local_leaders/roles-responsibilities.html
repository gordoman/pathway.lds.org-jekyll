        <p>Because Pathway is administered at the local level, BYU-Idaho relies heavily on priesthood and auxiliary leaders, institute directors, and Pathway Church service missionaries for the on-site management and ongoing success of the program.</p>

        <h3 class="p-heading blue">Roles of Priesthood Leaders</h3>
        <p>Priesthood support is vital to the success of the program at each individual Pathway location. While BYU-Idaho does not direct the priesthood in their duties, the university does ask local priesthood leaders to offer support and assist in the process of identifying Church members who could potentially benefit from Pathway's educational and spiritual blessings.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pf-section no-icon">
        <p>The basic priesthood roles in support of Pathway include:</p>
        <ul>
          <h4 class="p-heading2 blue">AREA SEVENTIES</h4>
          <li>Garner strong stake leadership support for Pathway</li>
          <li>Establish recruitment goals and distribute responsibility</li>
          <li>Coordinate multi-stake cooperation and execution</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4 class="p-heading2 blue">STAKE PRESIDENCIES</h4>
          <li>Assist with initial program implementation</li>
          <li>Identify and call Church service missionaries</li>
          <li>Work with Pathway Church service missionaries to ensure program success</li>
          <li>Encourage other stake leaders and ward bishoprics to support the program</li>
          <li>Assist in the recruitment of prospective students</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="pf-section no-icon">
        <h3 class="p-heading blue">Role of Institutes</h3>
        <p>Because Pathway's primary target audience is Church members between the ages of 18 and 30, local institute directors play an important role in the program. Institute directors help Pathway by coordinating institute classes for Pathway students, offering institute courses for transferrable credit, and much more.

        <a id="roleofpathwaymissionaries"></a><h3 class="p-heading blue">Role of Pathway Missionaries</h3>
        <p>BYU-Idaho relies heavily on Church service missionaries to assist with the on-site management of Pathway. While priesthood leaders and institute directors support the program, the missionaries do the bulk of the work to ensure Pathway is successful and that students have a meaningful experience. Missionaries are primarily asked to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Promote Pathway by personally engaging priesthood and auxiliary leaders in each stake and ward</li>
          <li>Identify and recruit potential students by: a) working with local priesthood/auxiliary leaders, and b) implementing a variety of recruiting tactics</li>
          <li>Facilitate weekly Pathway gatherings</li>
          <li>Monitor student academic success, participation, attendance, and retention</li>
        </ul>
